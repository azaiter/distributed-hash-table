# Simple Distributed Hash Table

Author: Abdulrahman (Zack) Zaiter

This program is a proof of concept of simple cloud-native distributed hash table implementation, each peer is a docker container within a contained docker-compose network.

## Requirements:
- Docker and Docker-Compose
- That's it.

## To Run:
- `docker-compose down; docker-compose build; docker-compose up`
- That's it

# Current design vs. Other designs:

### There are 5 points that are worth to be discussed:
#### 1- Nodes/Peers initialization process:
The book [_Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach by Kurose, sixth edition_](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-6th/dp/0132856204) does not mention any algorithm or means for the nodes/peers to connect and be aware of each other without using broadcast address, In this application, the initialization and configuration of the peers has to be done in the `INIT_CONFIG` environment variable to know current/previous/subsequent1/subsequent2 peers/nodes.

#### 2- Consensus of peers/states:
The algorithm does not guarantee a stable and highly available state of the peers as it does not have any mechanism to do so, it distributes the work based on the key to available nodes in the peers chain. One advantage that the current application have over the book's algorithm is that every node/peer is capable of serving the set and get commands.

#### 3- Data:
The data in a specific peer gets lost if the peer decides to leave, the data is distributed and not replicated.

#### 4- Re-arrangement of keys:
If a node decides to join/leave, the data the exists inside the already existing nodes/peers will stay as is and a re-arrangement is needed for optimal keys distribution, this is not accounted for in this application or the algorithm in the book.

#### 5- Collision of hashes
The algorithm in the book does not mention how to handle collision on hash handling and assumes that the keys are collision free despite that the algorithm used for hashing is extremely prone to collisions. The way I handled the collisions in this application is that for each hash key, I created an internal hash table that takes the original string key and an array of values, therefore, the searching algorithm will look if the hash exists, if so, it looks for the internal key, if it exists, it returns the array of values it has saved.

## Application Design:
- Assumes a circular arrangement of peers.
- Each peer will hold a small subset of the totality of the (key, value) pairs.
- Keys  are  content  names  (e.g.,  names  of  movies,  albums,  and  software,  or  file),  and  the  value  is  be  the  any data  at  which  the  content  is  stored;  in  this  case,  an  example  key-value  pair  is  (Led  Zeppelin  IV,  Some Value).
- Each Peer should provide the following services to a user:
    - Insert a (content name,  data) pair into the DHT â€“ we are assuming that the user has a content at his key that they want the DHT to be aware of.
    - The user enters the content name and their data
    - The peer should then store the (content name, data) pair in one of the peers in the DHT
- Retrieve data values corresponding to a given content name
    - The user enters a content name
    - The peer should return the list of all the data values where the content is available
    - The user should contact one of the can do whatever with the data .
- Maintain DHT when a peer:
    - Abruptly leaves the DHT
    - Wants to join the DHT
